# Python Type Inference

## TODO
- Determine argument types from what is passed
- Classes/attribute lookup
- Unpacking for nested tuples/lists
  - Requires implementing of a struct type that contains ordered types
- Add logic for updating types in higher scopes that were declared as global or nonlocal in lower scopes
- Split up the test code into different unittests
- Logic for yields and raises
